BOWTIE2 ALIGN. INFORMATION:

92904 reads; of these:
  92904 (100.00%) were paired; of these:
    92904 (100.00%) aligned concordantly 0 times
    0 (0.00%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time
    0 (0.00%) aligned concordantly >1 times
    ----
    92904 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:
      0 (0.00%) aligned discordantly 1 time
    ----
    92904 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:
      185808 mates make up the pairs; of these:
        103620 (55.77%) aligned 0 times
        70954 (38.19%) aligned exactly 1 time
        11234 (6.05%) aligned >1 times
44.23% overall alignment rate

-----------------

FASTQINS INFORMATION:

92904 reads provided; of these:
  92904 (100.0%) passed the PCR duplicates filter; of these:
    86455 (93.06%) presented the IR:TACGGACTTTATC sequence; of these:
      49047 having IR (56.73%) were mapped unambiguously; in total:
        47724 insertion positions can be extracted from 36424 reads
52.79% of the sample was informative: 6% coverage (number of insertions per genome base).
-----------------

OUTPUT INFORMATION:

The following files are generated as default output:
	- *_fw.qins - read counts of insertions mapping to forward strand
	- *_rv.qins - read counts of insertions mapping to reverse strand
	- *.qins - read counts of insertions mapping to both strands
	- *.bam - file generated with the aligned reads. Allows visual revision and additional processing
	- *.log - log file with general features of the process run
