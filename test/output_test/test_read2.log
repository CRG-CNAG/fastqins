BOWTIE2 ALIGN. INFORMATION:

100000 reads; of these:
  100000 (100.00%) were paired; of these:
    16541 (16.54%) aligned concordantly 0 times
    75343 (75.34%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time
    8116 (8.12%) aligned concordantly >1 times
    ----
    16541 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:
      5039 (30.46%) aligned discordantly 1 time
    ----
    11502 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:
      23004 mates make up the pairs; of these:
        12243 (53.22%) aligned 0 times
        8205 (35.67%) aligned exactly 1 time
        2556 (11.11%) aligned >1 times
93.88% overall alignment rate

-----------------

FASTQINS INFORMATION:

100000 reads provided; of these:
  PCR duplicate removal not selected. 100000 considered; of these:
    81066 (81.07%) presented the IR:TACGGACTTTATC sequence; of these:
      76698 having IR (94.61%) were mapped unambiguously; in total:
        46448 unique insertion positions can be extracted from 76698 informative reads
    76.7% of the sample reads were informative: 5.69% coverage (number of insertions per genome base).

-----------------

OUTPUT INFORMATION:

The following files are generated as default output:
	- *_fw.qins - read counts of insertions mapping to forward strand
	- *_rv.qins - read counts of insertions mapping to reverse strand
	- *.qins    - read counts of insertions mapping to both strands
	- *.bam     - file generated with the aligned reads. Allows visual revision and additional processing
	- *.log     - log file with general features of the process run
